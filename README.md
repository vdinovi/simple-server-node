# Simple Server
 New iteration on a previous web-app learning project this time using Node/MySQL/Socket.io.
 
 Plans for the immediate future:
  - ✓ Simplistic user database
  - ✓ Basic IRC-like chat system
  - ✓ User profiles with customizability.
  - ✓ File transfer and management 
 
 I will occasionaly be hosting it on an AWS EC2 Container for testing (Don't have an external IP on university internet)
