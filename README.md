# Simple Server
New iteration on a previous web-app learning project. This time I'll be creating my server using the node framework instead of a LAMP stack as before. One big reason for the transition for the transition is that I decided I wanted to support websocket connections for a realtime chat service which is tricky to do using exclusively php. Instead, Node and socket.IO seemed to be a better and simpler option. Hopefully the migration goes smoothly.

Plans for the immediate future:
 - ✓ Simplistic user database
 - ✓ Basic IRC-like chat system
 - ~ User profiles with customizability.
 - File transfer and management

I will occasionaly be hosting it on an AWS EC2 Container for testing (Don't have an external IP on university internet)
