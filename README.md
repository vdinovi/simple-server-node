# Simple Server
New iteration on a previous learning project webserver using the node framework instead of a LAMP stack as before. One big reason for the transition is that I decided I wanted to support websocket connections which is tricky to do using only php. Node and socket.IO seemed to be a better option. Hopefully a lot of the migration goes smoothly.

Plans for the immediate future:
 - Simplistic user database
 - Basic IRC-like chat system, perhaps DMs later.
 - File transfer and management
